### Hi there 👋

I’m Rober Díaz, a software engineer focused on turning complex legacy systems into high-performance, adaptable platforms. These days, I’m building autonomous AI agents, paying close attention to reliability, strong test coverage, and architectures that can handle rapid change in startup environments.
